# Snake #

My take on the classic "Snake" game, using the Pygame Library

## Controls ##

Use the arrow keys to move the head of the snake.

Press spacebar to pause or unpause the game

## Objectives ##

Avoid making contact with any of your body segments, the edges of the screen, or with SpikeBalls!

Touching the head of the snake to a piece of food will increase your score, but also increase your body length.

Different food types will have different effects.

Eating enough food will increase the level, resulting in more points, but also more danger!

Have fun!
