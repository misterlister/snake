# Snake #

My take on the classic "Snake" game, using the Pygame Library

## Controls ##

Use the arrow keys to move the head of the snake.

Press spacebar to pause or unpause the game

## Objectives ##

Avoid making contact with any of your body segments, the edges of the screen, or with SpikeBalls!

Touching the head of the snake to a piece of food will increase your score, but also increase your body length.

Different food types will have different effects:

- Red Apples: Normal food, gives you points equal to the level you have reached.
- Green Melons: Triple points!
- Yellow Lemons: Golden Glow! Gives you double the points for the next food you eat.
- Blue Blueberry: Shield Food. Grants you a shield which will protect you from the next collision with a SpikeBall
- Purple Grapes: Slow Food. Slows you down, making it easier to maneuver the snake.
- Pink Mystery Box: Has a variety of random effects. Try it and see!

Eating enough food will increase the level, resulting in more points, but also more danger!

Have fun!
